china made this virus,0
"Something that was posted on a CT site about CovId-19 - is probably just a theory, but I thought that it was interesting. He was saying that the reason that it would be hard to find a cure for it, is because the makeup of the virus is such- that the bodies immune system doesn't even recognize it as an invader.",0
Ok so I like numbers too and things are not adding up. China reports only 3232 deaths from COVID-19 yet 21 million cell phone subscribers have suddenly disappeared in China? Meanwhile Italy is averaging 700 to 800 deaths per day and France and Spain are well in their way to meeting these quotas.,0

This whole virus hoax was orchestrated for the next global recession and human depopulation..,0
Ozone kills bacteria and viruses including corona virus by creating a third oxygen molecule which then dissipates rapidly. Ozone generators saturate every surface in a closed space not just those exposed disinfectant or ultraviolet light. I think they would be a game changer in possibly disinfecting PPEs I haven't heard anyone discussing this. Please pass this on to the authorities unaware of this possibility for their consideration.,0
Thank you for your attention to this matter.,0
Demand free speech for experts and doctors who question the official narrative and hold the officials responsible for unnecessary shutdown and suspension of our Constitutional rights based on questionable gathering of statistics on this coronavirus.

"STRESS TURNS OFF YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM IT IS WHY PEOPLE GET ULCERS, WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE TO PLAY CARD GAMES, DO FUN THINGS, OTHERWISE THEY BECOME AS MUCH PITRI DISHES FOR THIS EPIDEMIC AS THE ANIMALS IN THE WET MARKETS THAT WERE STRESSED AND BECAME PITRI DISHES FOR THE VIRUS, IT IS THE CAUSES AND A CLUE TO THE SOLUTION. HOW DO YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR LAST DAYS? FUCKING MISERABLE OR HAPPY.",0
Sir Covid19 can be cured by practicing gurudev siyag siddha yoga. Till date millions of people cured from drastic diseases may be it Aids or HEMOPHILIA. A matter of research for scientists.,0
"Pure speculation... Here, Paris France, no mold, no pollution and full of coronavirus",1
"You sir, yes you, the one who wrote this post, sir, please go back to your work without any protective gears for next one month. Talk, shake hands, kiss others like before. And show all that to us by going live on FB. If you still survive by the end of next month, we will definitely think about this post.",1
"Do your part to protect frontline health care professionals. If you don't need to go out, the best thing you can do to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic is to #StayHome. ",1
"We don’t want thank you letters , we want masks and gowns and hand sanitizer , disability insurance for all of us , people to listen to scientists and stay home , people to stop hoarding the things we need to survive , that’s what we need not empty words",1
"We need masks and other personal Protective Equipment not some damn app, wake up!! you are supposed to be stressed in a PANDEMIC! Give us tools to defend our health and properly care for our patients. This is a pathetic response",1
Your not telling the truth anyone who can do math saw this coming in early January why didnt we stock up why wait till now. You wont answer that question. Doctors are still sending people to non essential appts. last week. We knew it was coming then. But your blaming the supply chain. Try this YOU DONT UNDERSTAND MATH! so you screwed up. You have failed in a tremendous way now what? we are asked to sacrifice so the lucky few who can see a doctor get health care while the rest of us go it alone. Like its always been in your profession and so it remains.,1
"I think much of this ambivalence is the product of a Federal administration at odds with science and factual data. From the start, Trump downplayed the threat of this virulent virus with one lie after another in a vain attempt to maintain an artificially pumped economy, re-election being his primary objective at the expense of American lives. There will be no economy left to save if this virus goes unchecked. Democrats have laid out a package that will keep unemployed Americans afloat throughout the shutdown and provide hospitals with everything they need, but the Trump administration stands in the way.",1
How could we as a modern society not have enough masks or equipment for our medical professionals? Very sad some at the top didn’t do their jobs to make sure hospitals have plenty of resources on hand under normal conditions and a plan set in place for a national emergency!,1
"So I am in the ER in Southern NJ... The doctors say I do not meet criteria for testing. But that they do think I have it. They are running labs, chest xray and giving me fluids. They said if tests become more readily available that I could get one. ---- They don't have enough tests. They have to save them for the critical patients. A lot of these are going undocumented. The numbers that are being reported to the government are not accurate because there are so many more. They said to quarantine myself. They are going to test me for the flu also.",1
"It's amazing to me that no one wants to believe the healthcare professionals and scientists, but their willing to believe one man who has done nothing but lie since he took office. These people are putting their lives on the line for you and some of u can do is bash them and continue praising a man who doesnt know his ass from a hole in the ground. Rant over",1
